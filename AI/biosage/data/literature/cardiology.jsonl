{"doc_id":"cardio_acs_001","title":"Chest pain evaluation and ACS diagnosis","year":2021,"tags":["cardiology","ACS"],"text":"Acute coronary syndrome typically presents with pressure-like substernal chest pain, often radiating to the left arm or jaw, associated with dyspnea, diaphoresis, and nausea. Diagnosis relies on serial high-sensitivity troponin testing and 12-lead ECG to detect ischemic changes. Risk stratification guides management, including antiplatelet therapy and early invasive strategy when indicated."}
{"doc_id":"cardio_afib_001","title":"Atrial fibrillation recognition and initial management","year":2020,"tags":["cardiology","arrhythmia"],"text":"Atrial fibrillation commonly presents with palpitations, dyspnea, or fatigue. An irregularly irregular rhythm without distinct P waves is seen on ECG. Initial management includes rate control, anticoagulation based on CHA2DS2-VASc score, and consideration of rhythm control in selected patients."}
{"doc_id":"cardio_hf_001","title":"Heart failure diagnosis and management","year":2022,"tags":["cardiology","heart_failure"],"text":"Heart failure presents with exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and peripheral edema. Elevated BNP/NT-proBNP supports the diagnosis, and transthoracic echocardiography assesses ejection fraction and structural heart disease. Management includes diuretics, ACE inhibitors/ARNI, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid antagonists, titrated to guideline-directed doses."}
{"doc_id":"cardio_pericard_001","title":"Acute pericarditis: clinical features and evaluation","year":2019,"tags":["cardiology","pericarditis"],"text":"Acute pericarditis presents with sharp pleuritic chest pain improved by leaning forward. ECG shows diffuse ST segment elevation with PR depression. Echocardiography assesses for pericardial effusion and tamponade. NSAIDs and colchicine are first-line therapy."}
