{"doc_id":"neuro_stroke_001","title":"Acute ischemic stroke: recognition and imaging","year":2020,"tags":["neurology","stroke"],"text":"Ischemic stroke presents with sudden focal neurological deficits such as unilateral weakness, aphasia, or visual field loss. Immediate non-contrast CT excludes hemorrhage; diffusion-weighted MRI is more sensitive for early ischemia. Time-sensitive reperfusion therapies include IV thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy in eligible patients."}
{"doc_id":"neuro_tia_001","title":"Transient ischemic attack: workup and secondary prevention","year":2018,"tags":["neurology","TIA"],"text":"TIA is defined by transient neurological deficits without infarction. Early risk stratification (e.g., ABCD2 score) informs admission decisions. Evaluation includes vascular imaging, echocardiography, and rhythm monitoring. Secondary prevention includes antiplatelet therapy, statins, blood pressure control, and addressing cardioembolic sources."}
{"doc_id":"neuro_seizure_001","title":"First-time seizure evaluation","year":2019,"tags":["neurology","seizure"],"text":"Generalized tonic-clonic seizures feature loss of consciousness, convulsions, and postictal confusion. Workup includes metabolic panel, toxicology screen, and EEG to detect epileptiform activity; brain imaging is indicated to exclude structural lesions. Counseling addresses driving restrictions and seizure precautions."}
{"doc_id":"neuro_migraine_001","title":"Migraine with aura: diagnosis and management","year":2017,"tags":["neurology","migraine"],"text":"Migraine with aura presents with transient visual disturbances followed by throbbing headache. Diagnosis is clinical. Red flags necessitate neuroimaging. Acute therapy includes triptans and NSAIDs; preventive options include beta-blockers, topiramate, and CGRP antibodies."}
