Chest CT characterizes lesions; tissue diagnosis via bronchoscopic or excisional lymph node biopsy establishes histology. Staging guides therapy, including surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation depending on subtype and stage."}

Elevated LDH may correlate with tumor burden. Excisional lymph node biopsy is preferred for definitive diagnosis and subclassification, which informs therapy with chemoimmunotherapy and targeted agents."}

CBC with differential shows anemia and blasts; flow cytometry and cytogenetics define subtype. Prompt initiation of induction chemotherapy is standard after confirmation."}
